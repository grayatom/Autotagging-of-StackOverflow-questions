# Autotagging-of-Stackoverflow-Questions
A Data Science Project

This is essentially a multilabel classification problem. We feed our model with many questions(title + body). 
The model learns through these inputs and when provided with a question, it assigns relevant tag(s) (c++, python, java, android, web development, etc...) to it.
Stackoverflow is a discussion forum where people post their queries, essentially technical, and other people respond to it.
